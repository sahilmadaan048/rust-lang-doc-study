    //string can be mutated but not string literals

    //reason lies in how these two deal with the memory

    //stringliteralswe know the contents at compile timethis iswhy the text is hardcoded into the executable file, thus they are efficient and fast
    //these come from string literals immutability
    //String => mutable, growable piece of text => on heap
    //this memory is requested from the memory allocator at runntime
    //we need to return this memory to the memory allocatpor when we are done with our String

    in rust that memory is freed as sonn as the variable that owns it gies out of scope

       Keeping track of what parts of code are using what data on the heap, minimizing the amount of
       duplicate data on the heap, and cleaning up unused data on the heap so you donâ€™t run out of
       space are all problems that ownership addresses.
