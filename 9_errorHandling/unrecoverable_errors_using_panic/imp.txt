The environment variable to enable backtraces in Rust is:

```sh
RUST_BACKTRACE=1
```

### Usage:
Run your Rust program with backtrace enabled in the terminal:

```sh
RUST_BACKTRACE=1 cargo run
```

or for a compiled binary:

```sh
RUST_BACKTRACE=1 ./your_binary
```

### Levels:
- `RUST_BACKTRACE=0` (default): No backtrace.
- `RUST_BACKTRACE=1`: Show a short backtrace.
- `RUST_BACKTRACE=full`: Show a full, detailed backtrace.

This helps debug crashes and panics by displaying the call stack. ðŸš€
