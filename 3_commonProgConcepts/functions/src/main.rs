The main error message, mismatched types, reveals the core issue w
ith this code. The definition of the function plus_one says that it will
 return an i32, but statements donâ€™t evaluate to a
  value, which is expressed by (), the unit type. Therefore
  , nothing is returned, which contradicts the function definition and results
   in an error. In this output, Rust provides a message to possibly
    help rectify this issue: it suggests removing the semicolon, which would fix the error.
