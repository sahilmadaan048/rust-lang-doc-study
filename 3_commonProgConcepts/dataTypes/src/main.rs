data type tells which kind pf data is benig stored by te variable
scalar and comppund data types



scalar sata typesare of 4 types
integer, floating, characters, booleans


So how do you know which type of integer to use? If youâ€™re unsure,
Rustâ€™s defaults are generally good places to start: integer types default
to i32. The primary situation in which youâ€™d use
 isize or usize is when indexing some sort of collection.
