what we will learn ?

useful data strcutures oin rust stamndard library are called collections
most data types have one specofoc value, but collections can contain 
multiple values

the data stored in the data types unlike array s and tuple types, is stored
on the heap, which means the amount of data does not need tio be known at the
compile time, and can grow or shrink s the program runs


what collectiosn we will learn ?
1. vector => same like c++
2. string => collection of characters in depth we'll do 
3. hashmap => mose particular implementatoin of the generak data structure called a map 

create and update vectors, stroings and hash maps
