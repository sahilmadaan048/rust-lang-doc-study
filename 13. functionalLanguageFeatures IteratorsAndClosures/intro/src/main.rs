**Rust's features which are similar to functional programming languages
    * Closures => a function like construct you can stire in a variable
    * Iterators => a way of processing a series of elements
    * use closures and iterators in minigrep
    * performance analysis of closures and iterators (they are fast)

    **pattern matching and enums are also influenced by the functional style

**Closures and iterators are important to write idiomatic and fast rust code
